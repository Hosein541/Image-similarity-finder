# Image Similarity Search with FAISS

This project implements an **image similarity search system** using **FAISS** and **PyTorch**. The application allows users to upload an image, and the system retrieves the most visually similar images from a preprocessed dataset.

## Features
- Efficient **image similarity search** using FAISS.
- **Deep feature extraction** using a pretrained ResNet model.
- Upload an image and retrieve the top 5 similar images from the dataset.
- Easy-to-use **web interface** built with Flask.

## Example Outputs
The **`example_outputs`** folder contains several sample results generated by the project, including:
- **Uploaded images:** Example images uploaded to the system.
- **Result images:** Top similar images retrieved by the application.

### Example Workflow
1. An example image (`uploaded_image.jpg`) is uploaded.
2. The system retrieves and stores the 5 most similar images:
   - `result_1.jpg`
   - `result_2.jpg`
   - ...
3. These results demonstrate the functionality and effectiveness of the project.

You can use the **`example_outputs`** folder to quickly understand how the project operates without running the code.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A CUDA-enabled GPU (optional for faster computation)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hosein541/Image-similarity-finder.git
   cd Image-similarity-finder

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. Prepare the dataset and FAISS index: Run the prepare_data.py script to preprocess the dataset, extract image features, and create the FAISS index.
 ```bash
python prepare_data.py
```


4. Run the application: Start the Flask app to launch the web interface.
 ```bash
python app.py
```


5. Access the web app: Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.



## Notes

The uploaded images are stored temporarily in the static/uploads folder.

The result images are saved in the static/results folder.
